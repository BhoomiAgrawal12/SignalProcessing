"""Stage S5 driver: physical pre-checks -> two engines -> fusion voter.

Order of authority:
1. Hard physical constraints from S4 (FSK tone histogram, OFDM detection,
   constant-envelope test) can exclude classes outright.
2. Cumulant engine (explainable, no training data).
3. CVNet-RF (advisory; its 24 RadioML classes are mapped onto our class

Disagreement between engines is surfaced, never averaged away.
